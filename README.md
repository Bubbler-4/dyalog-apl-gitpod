# Dyalog-APL-Gitpod

Docker image for using Dyalog APL on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

The Docker image has the following installed:

* [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/) 18.2 Linux .deb build, unregistered
* [RIDE](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride) 4.4
* [Cider](https://github.com/aplteam/Cider) 0.11.0
* [Tatin](https://github.com/aplteam/Tatin) Client 0.69.0

If you open this on Gitpod, zero-footprint RIDE starts automatically,
and you can access it through a button on Gitpod IDE, which is at "Open Ports" - 4502 - "Open Browser".
This allows a user to try Dyalog APL on the browser without installing on the local machine.
(Install the [Gitpod browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/) to open with one click.)
